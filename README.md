# Flight-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project to predict the flight prices in India. The project is designed to can help traveler to predict their ticket price, so they can determine the airlines, departure times and prices that are efficient for them.

## Project Overview
Flight Price Prediction project aims to predict flight price in India based on the the flights time, duration, destination and when the ticket bought using mahine learning with `Regression Algorithm`. By analyzing the flights history data and identifying patterns, the project can help traveler to predict their ticket price, so they can determine the airlines, departure times and prices that are efficient for them. The project involves exploratory data analysis, data cleaning & preprocessing, feature engineering, model training & evaluation, and model improvement.
